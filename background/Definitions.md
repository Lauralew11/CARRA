**Golden Rules of Lupus Nephritis Outcomes **

*Principles *

1\) 20%-75% of cSLE patients will develop nephritis

2\) 82% of LN in cSLE develops within the first year of diagnosis; 92%
within 2 years

3\) Class V LN more often presents with nephrotic syndrome than class III
or IV

[Nephrotic Syndrome]{.underline}:

1.  The presence of nephrotic range proteinuria, which is a urine
    protein:creatinine ratio \>200 mg/mmol or if there is a 24 hour
    urine instead of a urine protein:creatinine ratio, it would be a 24
    hour protein excretion greater than protein \>50 mg/kg (\>40 mg/m^2^
    per hour) in 24 hours.

2.  Hypoalbuminemia (an albumin less than 2.5 g/dL)

4\) Short-term renal outcomes are worse in African Americans

5\) Short-term renal outcomes are worse in patients who present with GFR
\<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or nephrotic range proteinuria

[Short Term Renal Outcomes]{.underline}:

-   GFR will be separated into states for analysis:

    -   State 1: \>60ml/min/1.73 m2

    -   State 2: 30-60ml/min/1.73 m2

    -   State 3: \<30ml/min1.73 m2

    -   Assess change in GFR- initial GFR vs most recent GFR

-   Occurrence of remission:

-   Creatinine within normal range:

  Age                              Creatinine (serum)   
  -------------------------------- -------------------- --------------
  Child (\<12 years old)           0.3-0.7 mg/dL        27-62 umol/L
  Adolescent (12-17 years old)     0.5-1.0 mg/dL        44-88 umol/L
  Adult (18 years old and older)   0.6-1.1 mg/dL        53-97 umol/L

-   urine protein:creatinine ratio\<0.2

-   urine red blood cells\<10/high powered field

<!-- -->

-   Occurrence of end-stage renal disease, transplant, and/or dialysis.

6\) Rituximab is used as a steroid-sparing agent for induction in
proliferative LN

-   Usage in class III-IV vs class V lupus nephritis
